# Uses services.restic.backups (one job per repository).
# Each job gets its own systemd service/timer, logs, and CLI wrapper.
#
# CLI wrappers are added to PATH automatically:
#   restic-backups-minecraft-onedrive snapshots
#   restic-backups-minecraft-pc snapshots
#
# Manual trigger:
#   systemctl start restic-backups-minecraft-onedrive
